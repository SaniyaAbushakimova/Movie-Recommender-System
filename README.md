# Movie-Recommender-System

## Project Overview

This project is a Movie Recommender System that leverages **collaborative filtering techniques** to generate personalized movie recommendations. It is built using the **MovieLens dataset**, which includes approximately **1 million ratings** from **6,040 users** for **3,706 movies**, providing a rich foundation for analyzing user preferences and movie similarities.

The recommender system is implemented from scratch, focusing on two key recommendation strategies:
1. **Popularity-Based Recommendation** – Recommends movies based on overall popularity.
2. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)** – Uses similarity between movies to generate personalized recommendations for users.

Additionally, a **Movie Recommender Web App** was built to provide an interactive interface for users to explore and receive movie recommendations.

## Methods and Techniques Used

1. **Data Preprocessing**
* User-movie matrix construction from raw MovieLens ratings.
* Normalization and scaling to adjust for user rating biases.
* Sparsity reduction for efficient computations.

2. **Popularity-Based Recommendation**
* Movies are ranked based on the number of user ratings, with only those maintaining an average rating above 4.3 being considered.

3. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)**
* Similarity matrix calculation between movies based on user rating patterns.
* Uses Cosine Similarity to find relationships between movies.
* Recommendations are generated by identifying movies similar to those a user has rated highly.

## How to Run the Web App

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Run the Dash App:**
   
`python app.py`
